JAVASCRIPT REACT
- js library for building user interfaces
- defines way apps are written
- does this by setting clear rules about how data
can flow through the app and how the UI will adapt as a result of that 
changing data
- main features: components, states

- makes front-end JS a lot easier
- virtual DOM
- uses self-contained, independent components with their own states
- JSX - simplicity of HTML with power of JS

COMPONENTS 
- class components
	- has a state (title and body), function (rules), and render
	- UI "reacts" to changes in the state
- functional component

HOW UI IS INITALIZED
- on server side... very simple
- browser side ... has most functions and it will send it to the page
