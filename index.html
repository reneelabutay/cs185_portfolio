				Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Renee and I am a third year Computer Science major at UC Santa Barbara. I hope you have a great time exploring my website.
			</p>
			<p>
				To tell you more about myself, I was born and raised in the Bay Area. I am a huge foodie. I love exploring new restaurants and baking delicacies. Some of my favorite foods are sushi, matcha lattes, and chocolate croissants. I am currently on the search for the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To offset the vast amounts of food I consume everyday, I spend most of my free time bodybuilding and weightlifting. I enjoy living an active lifestyle. I grew up playing sports and used to be part of the UCSB Rowing Team. At the gym, there's no better feeling than achieving your strength goals.
